        "Vanilla Python is bad at storing and manipulating large amounts of data. Lists, dictionaries, sets and tuples are inherently slow and inefficient. If you're handling large amounts of data in a performance-critical area of your code, substantial gains can be made by using other data types to store your data.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most popular ways of holding large amounts of data  is through the use of the [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package. NumPy provides access to the powerful array data type which can store large N-dimensional arrays of data. As Numpy largely overlays compiled code written in the C language, it bypasses many of the weaknesses of Python to provide very fast performance for common linear algebra (and other) operations.\n",

In addition, the availability of intrinsic function specifically designed to generate a random array and perform a dot product both allow a specific and optimised implementation compared to the first version where we wrote the calculations in raw Python."
