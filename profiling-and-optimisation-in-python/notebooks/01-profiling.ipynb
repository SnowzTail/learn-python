        "## Why profile?\n",
        "\n",
        "Profiling is the act of finding the demands placed on your computer when a piece of code is run and, preferably, localising the demands to specific sections of code. This is important when optimising as it allows you to find which parts of your code contribute to the demand you want to reduce and then target your optimisation efforts there.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, if ```function_1``` takes 99% of the runtime of your code and ```function2``` takes the rest, there is no point in optimising ```function2``` as even reducing the runtime to zero for that function would not produce a noticable impact on the runtime of the code as a whole. Instead, optimising ```function1``` should be the priority.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this reason, when optimising a code, the first step is to profile it. This means the time you spend optimising your code will have most impact.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Effects of Profiling\n",
        "\n",
        "One important note when using any profiling technique is that it can impact the run-time and memory usage of the code. This is because tracking various aspects of performance can actually impact performance as more information needs to be collected. As such, it's sometimes necessary to run a profiler on a reduced scale problem so the code runs in a reasonable time.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Profiling Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a number of different profiling tools available for use in Python. In this notebook, we will look at a sample of them - favouring ones which are simple to implement in a Jupyter Notebook. However, this list is far from exhaustive.\n",
        "\n",
        "The examples in this section relate to running this notebook in Colab. To run this notebook in Anaconda locally a different approach may be required in some cases. Many of the commands are also available from the command line when profiling a ```.py``` file. Again, a different approach will be required in this usage case."

        "## Profiling Effectively\n",
        "\n",
        "### Profiling Runs\n",
        "\n",
        "In many cases, when profiling and optimising a large and complex code, it is not possible to perform full-scale executions of the code. This may be because, for example, the code is designed to run on HPC resources but you're profiling on your desktop. Or it may be that you expect the codes to take hours or days to run and you want to make your profiling and optimising cycle shorter.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, it may be that a code may be used in a number of different ways, such as performing many different kinds of simulation or analysing many different kinds of data set. It may be that the code can be run with a multitude of different options that will invoke different parts of the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "These considerations may mean that simply \"profiling the code\" is not a striaghtforward affair. Which use cases do you profile? It may be that you need to develop a suite of cases to profile to get a measure of how the code performs in different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Length of Profiling Runs\n",
        "\n",
        "One other consideration that should always be taken into account is that a very short piece of code will be prone to relatively larger noise than a longer execution of code. For instance, if profile the same bit of code twice, you may get noticably different runtimes if on one occassion your computational resources were split due to another task taking place on your computer (for instance, if a software update is taking place). This means that a code needs to run for at least a few seconds for profiling to produce meaningful results.\n",
        "\n",
        "One solution if you're working with a shorter piece of code is to run it many times and look at the total time taken. However, if this is the case, you need to make sure that the overhead of looping over the piece of code to be profiled is not taking up too large a portion of the run-time.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Profiling Effective - Takeaway\n",
        "\n",
        "There isn't a simple answer to ensure you get an effective profile of your code as it may be very problem-specific. You should try to think about what your code is doing and what you want to profile carefully and develop a strategy. Then repeat the profiling a few times to ensure the results remain the same."

        "\n",
        "Profiling the run-time of the code is probably one of the most important parts of profiling. In many cases, the amount of time the code takes to run is the most limiting factor when deciding if a particular simulation can be carried out on the available computational resources in a reasonable amount of time. There are several useful bits of useful information we can gather.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Profiling By Function\n",
        "Profiling by function gives us a high-level idea of how often functions are called and how long those calls last. One way to do this is to import the ```cProfile``` module and run a function using the ```cProfile.run()``` function, providing a string argument which is the command used to invoke the function."

One meaningful measuerment which can be made is the difference in the amount of memory used at two different points in the program. If the first point is the start of the program then this will give a good approximation of how much memory is in use at the second point. Often it will be desirable for the second point to be when the maximum memory is in use and this may take some experimentation to find.\n",
