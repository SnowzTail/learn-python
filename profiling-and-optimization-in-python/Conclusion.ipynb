Despite being a central part of Grand Theft Auto V, the [most profitable piece of media ever](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-04-09-gta-v-is-the-most-profitable-entertainment-product-of-all-time), it has been plagued with extreme loading times for the best part of a decade. Eventually, one player and skilled developer took the time to profile and optimise the loading process and cut loading times by about 70%. This [informative write-up](https://nee.lv/2021/02/28/How-I-cut-GTA-Online-loading-times-by-70/) goes a bit beyond what we cover in this course but, hopefully, you should still be able to see some parallels with what we've discussed in this course. This shows that, even for the biggest companies in the world, profiling and optimisation is extremely important."]}]}
