You should also [download the course materials](https://github.com/coolernato/Managing-and-Running-Python-Effectively/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to your computer.

### Face to Face Course

This course will take place in an ICT computer room and so laptops are not required. However, if you have one, it is recommended you bring it (fully charged) as, over the course, you will configure various applications to run Python and you will be able to keep these configured applications for future use. In addition, some tasks are easier to complete on a laptop where you will ahve adminstrator privileges. If you will be using your own laptop, please install:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
* [A recent edition of the Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

You should also [download the course materials](https://github.com/coolernato/Managing-and-Running-Python-Effectively/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to your computer.

If you will beusing an ICT room computer, you will be using applications available through the [Software Hub/Apps Anywhere](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/admin-services/ict/self-service/computers-printing/devices-and-software/get-software/software-hub/). You should read the documentation on the linked page and test using Apps Anywhere so you are familiar with its operation.

### Self-Study Instructions

This course is best experienced through a live session (online webinar or in-person workshop) and it is strongly recommended to attedn such a course if possible. However, this course can also be completed through self-study from this repository. Before beginning the course, you should install on your computer:

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
* [A recent edition of the Python interpreter](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)

You should also [download the course materials](https://github.com/coolernato/Managing-and-Running-Python-Effectively/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to your computer. You will then be able to work through the PowerPoint slide show. When doing so, make sure to read the "notes" section under the slide as this will expand upon the content of the slides.

## Pacakages

We will be usig a variety of packages during the course. However, as the installation and management of packages is an integral part of the course, we will install these packages live, so there is no need to install packages in advance.
