    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now efficiently define complex families of related classes in Python. This becomes even more powerful once we consider the idea of \"polymorphism\". Polymorphism essentially means that, when we write code, we don't actually know what type a particular variable will have when the code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ties into the idea of \"duck typing\" which is at the heart of Python. Variables may be any type at all and, providing they have the required method, they can be used in a piece of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example. In the code cell below, the shape classes we've been working on are defined. In the cell below that is some code which creates a list of various different shapes and then loops over the list, printing something about each shape as it's considered."
