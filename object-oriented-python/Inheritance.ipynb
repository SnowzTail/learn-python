When developing software, repetition is undesirable so it would great if we could avoid this repetition. Fortunately Python, like other object-oriented languages uses the idea of inheritance to do just that.\n","\n","In Python, one class (sometimes refer to as the \"child class\" or the \"subclass\") may inherit from another (sometimes referred to as the \"parent class\" or \"superclass\"). This means that the child class acquires all of the parent class' methods and properties.\n","\n","As an example, let's consider our ```Square``` class again. This class may be part of a family of classes describing different regular polygons, so we could create a ```RegularPolygon``` class that it descends from. This means we can put code into the ```RegularPolygon``` class which will be useful for all regular polygons and only put things into the square class which will be useful for describing squares.\n","\n","Before we start, let's think about what properties each class might have and whether they will be properties of all regular polygons or just a square:\n","\n","| All Regular Polygons | Squares |\n","|------|-------|\n","| Colour  |  Number of sides|\n","| Side length | Area |\n","|  | Perimeter |\n","\n","Now, let's begin by writing the ```RegularPolygon``` class definition."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"UL5h29jQU9EE"},"source":["class RegularPolygon:\n","  # A constructor which takes the colour and side length and sets them\n","  def __init__(self, colour, side_length):\n","    self._colour = colour\n","    self._side_length = side_length\n","\n","  # A property to return the colour\n","  @property\n","  def colour(self):\n","    return(self._colour)\n","\n","  # A property to return the side length\n","  @property\n","  def side_length(self):\n","    return(self._side_length)\n","\n","#Make an test an example\n","polygon = RegularPolygon(\"green\", 2)\n","print(polygon.colour)\n","print(polygon.side_length)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"RsaTcvi27azZ"},"source":["## Inheriting\n","\n","Now, let's create the ```Square``` class.

So, careful thought about what can go into the child class can reduce the amount of code that needs to be written and maintained overall.\n","\n","In the case of our shapes, we've already put the colour and side length properties in the parent class ```RegularPolygon```, but we can actually shift more into there as well to make our children class even simpler.\n","\n","For instance, we can note that the ```perimeter``` class is always multiplying the side length by the number of sides. The formula is always the same, so we can move it to the parent class.\n","\n","Another change we can make is to note that the constructor of the ```Square``` and ```Triangle``` classes doesn't actually do anything other than call the constructor of the ```RegularPolygon``` class.
