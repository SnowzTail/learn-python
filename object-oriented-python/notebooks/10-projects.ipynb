They would like you to write a way to store data relating to a variety of different products they make, including the materials needed to produce them and the cost of those materials. The carpenter uses only wood and nails to produce their products and the amount of each they need depends on the size of the individual product they are producing. All lengths are measured in metres.\n","\n","The products and the required materials are:\n","\n","* Desk\n","  - Parameterised by width and length\n","  - Wood required = 2 x length x width + 4\n","  - Nails required = 4\n","* Fence\n","  - Parameterised by length\n","  - Wood required = length x 4\n","  - Nails required = length x 2\n","* Chair\n","  - All chairs are the same\n","  - Wood required = 4\n","  - Nails required = 8\n","\n","1m of wood costs £5 and each nail costs £1. Write a series of classes to represent these products with properties to calculate the amount of wood and nails a individual product needs taking the size of the individual product into account. Another property should calculate the cost of materials for the product.\n","\n","The carpenter also wants to create a function which accepts a list of these products and calculates the total cost of materials required for all the products.\n","\n","Then, the carpenter tells you this month they will be producing the following:\n","\n","* A desk with 2m length and 1m width\n","* A 10m fence\n","* A 12m fence\n","* 3 chairs\n","* A desk with 3m length and 2m width\n","\n","Create a list representing these products and pass it to your function.
